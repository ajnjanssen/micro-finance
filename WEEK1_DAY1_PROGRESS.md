### 2. Enhanced Import Service (`import-service-v2.ts`) âœ…

**750+ lines of intelligent import logic**

#### Key Features:

**Smart Categorization:**

- âœ… 15+ category rules with keyword matching
- âœ… Amount range validation
- âœ… Confidence scoring (0-100)
- âœ… Audit trail (reason for each categorization)
- âœ… Matched keywords tracking

**Advanced Recurring Detection:**

- âœ… Groups similar transactions automatically
- âœ… Analyzes intervals (weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- âœ… Checks amount consistency
- âœ… Calculates confidence based on:
  - Interval variance (coefficient of variation)
  - Amount variance
  - Number of occurrences
- âœ… Predicts next expected date
- âœ… Groups recurring transactions with IDs

**Automatic Configuration Extraction:**

- âœ… Detects income sources from recurring income
- âœ… Identifies recurring expenses
- âœ… Suggests potential loans from large payments
- âœ… Links transactions to configuration

**Data Quality:**

- âœ… Duplicate detection
- âœ… Date parsing (3 formats: YYYYMMDD, YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY)
- âœ… European amount format support (comma decimal)
- âœ… Warning generation (low confidence, unusual amounts)
- âœ… Comprehensive statistics

**Import Pipeline:**

```typescript
CSV Upload
  â†’ Parse CSV
  â†’ Convert to transactions
  â†’ Filter duplicates
  â†’ Auto-categorize (with confidence)
  â†’ Detect recurring patterns
  â†’ Extract tags
  â†’ Extract configuration
  â†’ Generate warnings
  â†’ Calculate statistics
  â†’ Identify needs review
  â†’ Return comprehensive result
```

### 3. Fixed Categorization Rules & Real Data âœ…

**Resolved user-reported issues with 200 transactions recategorized**

#### Issues Fixed:

1. **Salary Detection** - â‚¬171.50 vs â‚¬2,800

   - Added "exact cloud development" as primary keyword
   - Lowered minimum to â‚¬100 (allows partial payments)
   - Result: 6 transactions recategorized investment-income â†’ salary

2. **Groceries** - AH Paterswolde not recognized

   - Added "ah paterswolde" to groceries keywords

3. **Dining** - Tango restaurants (64 transactions)

   - Added "tango" to dining keywords

4. **Personal Transfers** - Friend loans

   - Added new categories: `personal-transfer`, `loan-to-friend`, `loan-from-friend`

5. **Rent** - Patrimonium service fees
   - Lowered minimum from â‚¬300 to â‚¬25

**Scripts Created:**

- `scripts/recategorize-with-v2.ts` - Batch recategorize
- `scripts/set-starting-balance-v2.ts` - Set starting balances

**Starting Balance Set:** checking-1 = -â‚¬2,255.07
