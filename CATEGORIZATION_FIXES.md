# 🎯 Categorization Issues Fixed!

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. ❌ **Wrong Salary Amount**

**Problem:** €171.50 categorized as "investment-income" instead of "salary"

- Transaction: "EXACT CLOUD DEVELOPMENT" €171.50

**Root Cause:** Import rules only had "exact cloud" keyword, which matched a different pattern first

**Fix:**

- ✅ Added "exact cloud development" as primary keyword
- ✅ Lowered minimum salary amount to €100 (allows partial payments)
- ✅ Recategorized 6 transactions from investment-income → salary

---

### 2. ❌ **Wrong Food Category**

**Problem:** Multiple transactions misclassified

#### Groceries:

- "AH Paterswolde PATERSWOLDE NLD" → uncategorized (should be groceries)

**Fix:**

- ✅ Added "ah paterswolde" to groceries keywords
- ✅ Recategorized 1 transaction

#### Dining:

- "Tango Groningen O GRONINGEN NLD" → food (should be dining/restaurants)
- "Tango Veendam L VEENDAM NLD" → food

**Fix:**

- ✅ Added "tango" to dining keywords (restaurant chain)
- ✅ Recategorized 64 transactions from food → dining

---

### 3. ❌ **Wrong Transfer Category**

**Problem:** "T R D Manuputty" €800 → housing (should be personal transfer)

**Root Cause:** No personal transfer category existed

**Fix:**

- ✅ Added new transaction categories: `personal-transfer`, `loan-to-friend`, `loan-from-friend`
- ✅ Added "manuputty" keyword to personal-transfer rules
- ✅ Recategorized 1 transaction from housing → personal-transfer

---

### 4. ❌ **Patrimonium Rent Amounts**

**Problem:** Only €29.97 showing, but actual rent is €727.33

**Root Cause:** Multiple Patrimonium transactions with different amounts

- Old rent: ~€692
- New rent: €727.33
- Additional charges: ~€30 (probably service costs)

**Fix:**

- ✅ Lowered minimum rent amount to €25 (catches service charges)
- ✅ All Patrimonium transactions now correctly categorized as "rent"
- ✅ Recategorized 8 transactions

---

### 5. ℹ️ **Starting Balance Issue**

**Problem:** Can't determine current balance from CSV imports with arbitrary date ranges

**Solution Created:**

- ✅ Created `set-starting-balance-v2.ts` script
- ✅ Allows manual setting of starting balance per account
- ✅ Removes old starting balance transactions automatically

**Usage:**

```bash
npx tsx scripts/set-starting-balance-v2.ts checking-1 -2255.07
npx tsx scripts/set-starting-balance-v2.ts savings-1 910.94
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Keyword Precision Matters:** "exact cloud" matched too broadly, needed "exact cloud development"

2. **Amount Ranges Critical:** Rent charges can vary (main rent + service costs)

3. **Category Granularity:** Separated:

   - food → groceries vs dining
   - transport → public-transport vs fuel
   - insurance → health-insurance vs other insurance

4. **Starting Balance Essential:** CSV imports need baseline - can't infer from partial data

5. **Personal Transfers Need Category:** Friend loans/repayments are distinct from housing/expenses
