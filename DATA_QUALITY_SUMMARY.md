## 📝 Notes

### Patrimonium Rent:

Your rent increased from ~€692 to €727.33. The system now detects both:

- Main rent payment: €727.33
- Service charges: ~€30

All are correctly categorized as "rent".

### Small Salary Payments:

The €171.50 payments are correctly identified as salary. If they're actually something else (reimbursement, allowance), you can manually correct them in the UI later.

### Starting Balance Date:

Set to 2025-09-30 (first day of current month). Adjust if needed:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/set-starting-balance-v2.ts checking-1 -2255.07 2025-01-01
```
