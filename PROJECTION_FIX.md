# 🔧 Projection Fix - Phantom Expenses Removed

## 🐛 Problem Identified

Your dashboard was showing **phantom future expenses** even with zero transactions:
- €400/month losses projected
- €59.77/month student debt starting April 2026
- Resulting in €-15,894 in 36 months

**Root Cause**: The projection logic was making **assumptions** instead of using actual data.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **1. Removed Conservative Estimate** 
**Before (Line 426-428):**
```typescript
// If we have no data or very low average, use conservative estimate
const conservativeEstimate =
  avgVariableExpenses > 100 ? avgVariableExpenses : 400; // ❌ Assumes €400!
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Only use actual data - no assumptions or estimates
const estimatedMonthlyExpenses = avgVariableExpenses; // ✅ Uses actual data only
```

### **2. Removed Hardcoded Student Debt**
**Before (Line 484-486):**
```typescript
// Student debt starting April 2026
if (projectionYear >= 2026 && projectionMonth >= 3) {
  monthlyChange -= 59.77; // ❌ Hardcoded debt payment
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ✅ Removed - if you have debt, add it as a recurring transaction
```

### **3. Added Scheduled Transaction Support**
**New Feature:**
```typescript
// Check for any scheduled one-time transactions in this month
const scheduledTransactions = data.transactions.filter((t) => {
  const txDate = new Date(t.date);
  return (
    txDate.getFullYear() === projectionYear &&
    txDate.getMonth() === projectionMonth &&
    txDate > new Date() // Only future transactions
  );
});

scheduledTransactions.forEach((tx) => {
  monthlyChange += tx.amount; // ✅ Includes future scheduled payments
});
```

## 🎯 New Projection Logic

### **Deterministic & Data-Driven**
Projections now **only** use:

1. ✅ **Actual recurring transactions** (marked `isRecurring: true`)
2. ✅ **Average variable expenses** from last 3 months (if data exists)
3. ✅ **Scheduled future transactions** (e.g., bonuses, planned purchases)
4. ❌ **NO assumptions** if no data exists
5. ❌ **NO hardcoded values**

### **Formula**
```
Future Balance = Current Balance + (Months × Monthly Net Change)

Where Monthly Net Change:
  + Recurring Income (from actual transactions)
  - Recurring Expenses (from actual transactions)
  - Average Variable Expenses (calculated from last 3 months)
  + Scheduled One-Time Transactions (future dated)
```

## 📊 Your Dashboard Now

### **With Zero Transactions:**
```
Totaal Saldo: €0.00
Projecties:
  - Oktober 2025: €0.00
  - Oktober 2026: €0.00  ✅ No phantom losses!
  - Oktober 2027: €0.00
  - Oktober 2028: €0.00
```

### **After Adding Data:**
Once you upload CSVs or add transactions:
- ✅ Recurring transactions will project forward
- ✅ Variable expenses averaged from actual data
- ✅ Future scheduled transactions included
- ✅ Realistic projections based on YOUR data

## 🎓 How to Add Recurring Expenses

If you have regular expenses (rent, subscriptions, etc.), they'll be **automatically detected** when you import them!

### **Auto-Detected Patterns:**
```typescript
// From transaction-validator.ts
- Salary: "exact cloud development" → Monthly
- Rent: "patrimonium" → Monthly  
- Insurance: "menzis" + "zorgverzekeraar" → Monthly
- Subscriptions: "netflix international b.v." → Monthly
- Bank fees: "oranjepakket" → Monthly
```

### **Manual Override:**
If you want to add a recurring transaction that won't be auto-detected, add it via the frontend with:
- ✅ `isRecurring: true`
- ✅ `recurringType: "monthly"` or `"yearly"`
- ✅ Future date (if not started yet)

---

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Fresh Start (Current State)**
```
Transactions: 0
Recurring Income: €0
Recurring Expenses: €0
Variable Expenses Average: €0

→ Projections: Flat €0 forever ✅
```

### **Scenario 2: After Importing Salary**
```
Transactions: 1 salary (€2850, recurring: monthly)
Recurring Income: €2850
Recurring Expenses: €0
Variable Expenses Average: €0

→ Projections: +€2850/month ✅
```

### **Scenario 3: Full Data**
```
Transactions: Salary + Rent + Insurance + Groceries
Recurring Income: €2850/month (salary)
Recurring Expenses: €800/month (rent + insurance)
Variable Expenses Average: €400/month (groceries, transport)

→ Projections: Net +€1650/month ✅
```

## 🚀 Test It Now

1. **Refresh your dashboard** - Should show €0 everywhere
2. **Upload a CSV** with some transactions
3. **Check projections** - Should reflect YOUR actual data
4. **Add recurring transaction** - Watch projections update

## 📝 Technical Changes

**File**: `src/services/financial-data.ts`  
**Method**: `projectBalance()`

**Changes:**
- Removed `conservativeEstimate` (€400 assumption)
- Removed hardcoded student debt (€59.77)
- Added scheduled transaction support
- Changed default from €400 to €0 when no data

**Impact:**
- ✅ Projections now deterministic
- ✅ Only use actual transaction data
- ✅ No phantom expenses
- ✅ Accurate representation of YOUR finances

---

## ✨ Result

**Before:** System assumed you spend €400/month even with zero data  
**After:** System only projects based on your actual transactions  

**Your financial projections are now truthful and data-driven!** 🎉
