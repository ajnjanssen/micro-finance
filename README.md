# 💸 Micro Finance

> *Because Excel spreadsheets are so 2005*

A personal finance app that helps you pretend you have your life together by projecting how rich (or poor) you'll be in 36 months. Spoiler: probably still broke, but at least you'll see it coming in a beautiful chart! 📉

## 🤔 What is this?

You know those finance apps that connect to your bank and judge your spending? This isn't that. This is the app for control freaks who:

- Want to **plan** their finances, not cry over past mistakes
- Prefer telling the app "my rent is €727.33" instead of importing 500 transactions
- Like to see pretty graphs going up (or down, no judgment)
- Think CSV imports should be optional, like exercise
- Actually enjoy manually entering their salary (said no one ever, but you do it anyway)

## ✨ What can it do?

- 📊 Show you fancy charts of your financial future (optimism sold separately)
- 💰 Track multiple accounts (checking, savings, crypto dreams, etc.)
- 🎯 Set savings goals (motorcycle: €6,400, dignity: priceless)
- 📈 Project your balance 3 years ahead (brace yourself)
- 💸 Custom budget percentages (because your 50/30/20 is more like 70/25/5)
- � Transfer money between accounts without Excel formulas
- 🧙 Smart onboarding wizard (asks better questions than your bank)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajnjanssen/micro-finance.git
cd micro-finance
npm install  # Makes magic happen
npm run dev  # Opens http://localhost:3000
```

First time? The onboarding wizard will hold your hand through setup. It's like IKEA instructions, but actually helpful.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - Because we like living on the edge
- **TypeScript** - So we know what broke before running it
- **TailwindCSS + DaisyUI** - Making ugly UIs pretty since 2023
- **JSON files** - Your data, your computer, no cloud drama

## 📂 How it works

1. You tell it your salary: "I make €2,800/month"
2. You tell it your expenses: "Rent is murdering me at €727.33"
3. It does math (the app, not you)
4. It shows you a graph
5. You either feel good or reconsider your Netflix subscription

The app stores everything locally in JSON files because:
- No subscription fees (ironic, right?)
- Your financial shame stays on your computer
- No cloud provider judging your spending on bubble tea

## 🎭 Philosophy

**Configuration > Calculation**

This app doesn't try to be smart by analyzing your spending patterns. Instead, *you* tell it what your financial life *should* look like, and it projects the future based on that. Think of it as financial planning, not financial therapy.

## 🤓 For Developers

- Modular components (because spaghetti code is for dinner)
- Custom hooks everywhere (we're fancy like that)
- Type-safe (mostly... okay, we tried)
- Projection engine that actually works (shocking, we know)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- May cause anxiety when projections show you'll never retire
- Charts occasionally tell the truth
- Budget percentages can't fix poor life choices (we tried)
- Won't help you explain your spending to your partner
